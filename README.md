# Cognizant_Certification
This is my work at Cognizant for Artificial Intelligence certification
In this Certification, I have completed the assigned task of creating a machine-learning model for production.
## Task - 1 Exploratory Data Analyst
  Exploration of the data provided by the client, to help them with supply chain problems. Where they needed help in maintaining the stock.
## Task - 2 Data Modelling
  From the given dataset, we have provided the insights as follow,
  
  -	The most frequently used payment method is in the form of cash.
  -	Non-members are frequent buyers of the store.
  -	11 a.m. is the busiest hour with regard to a number of transactions.
  -	Fruit & vegetables are the 2 frequently bought product categories.
The problem statement that we will solve here is,

“Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis in order to more intelligently procure products from our suppliers?”
## Task - 3 Model Building and Interpretation
  In this task, using the three provided datasets, we will combine, transform, and model these datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement.
## Task - 4 MAchine Learning Production
  To build a foundation for the Machine-learning model as promising and believe that with more data and time, it can add real value to the business.
